- 👋 Hi, I’m @GXavierdev

- 👀 I’m interested in Excel, VBA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. 
      I'm still interested in other languages as well as RUST, DART, etc because i'm so curious about tecnologies.
      I don't care about this language X is my favorite one. I just would like to know how about to do a "Hello World", in every language I need.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Web Site Tecnologies, becuase I'm still a beginer on programing, but I will became a FullStack Developer.
      I just love the process of learn everything. Don't blame me for that
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects about Excel and VBA because I'm good on it. So, I'm still looking for some project of websites or similar to that.

- 📫 You can find me seending an email to: guilherme.savio.leandro@gmail.com
      If you need, please don't hesitate to contact me
